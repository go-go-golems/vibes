I don't see any other problems that need solving.\n\n  my philosophy, in case you need to have it stated to avoid speculating\n  about it, is that in order to serve the needs of any community, one must\n  never, _ever_ to cater to the needs of ignorants and novices except in\n  carefully controlled settings where the express purpose is to make them\n  non-ignorants and non-novices, such as school or training courses.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
