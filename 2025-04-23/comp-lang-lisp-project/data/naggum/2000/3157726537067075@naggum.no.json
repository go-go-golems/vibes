Look that in your loop construct you\n| call (recursively) FLATTEN depending on the type of ELEMENT.  This is\n| clearly a case of recursion.\n\n  you're right, of course.  the recursion that I find silly, and therefore\n  reacted to, is using recursion to traverse lists, or recursing on the\n  CDR.  for the sake of argument, I ignored the recursion on the CAR.  I\n  think you made a good point for why that shouldn't be done.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
