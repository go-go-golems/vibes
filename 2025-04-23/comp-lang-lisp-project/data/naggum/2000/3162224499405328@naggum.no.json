Supporting several kinds of strings is *obviously*\n| sensible, I quibble about the compressing stuff being worth it.\n\n  compressing strings for in-memory representation of _arrays_ is nuts.\n  nobody has proposed it, and nobody ever will.  again, read the Unicode\n  technical report and decrease both your fear and your ignorance.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
