Slower?\nFrom: Erik Naggum <erik@naggum.no>\nDate: 2000/01/18\nNewsgroups: comp.lang.lisp\nMessage-ID: <3157208830761229@naggum.no>\n\n* Tony <TonyNOToSPAM@chice.force9.co.uk.invalid>\n| Some of the data is contained in simple-vectors, other bits\n| in arrays, within the structures, but the use of arrays is\n| wastefull in this situation as the ultimate size is unknown.\n\n  well, you _could_ use adjustable vectors with fill pointers if such is\n  your concern.  Common Lisp knows that the tradeoff that people made with\n  lists carried a performance penalty.  look at VECTOR-PUSH and VECTOR-POP\n  for ways to deal with unknown sizes and still get O(1) access times.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
