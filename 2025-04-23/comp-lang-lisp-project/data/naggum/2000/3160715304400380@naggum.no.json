Daniels\n| Anyway, #:Erik, now that you mention it, I notice *your* posts are oddly\n| similar, especially of late.\n\n  I apologize for the predictability, but there's so little variation in\n  the basic theme to which I respond.  as you may have noticed, the core\n  argument is that I'm not allowed to do X to anyone, but every other\n  person is allowed to do X to me a 100 times over.  it gets old quick.\n\n| the Lisp community depends on you for leadership in these uncertain times.\n\n  why, thank you.  I'm delighted that you, too, join the fan club.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
