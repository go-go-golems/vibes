Cooper\" <dcooper@genworks.com>\n| Let's say your string is in the variable called string.\n| \n| (eval (read-from-string string))\n| \n| This will evaluate exactly one expression from the string.  You'll have\n| to do something more (probably with subseq or something) to read and\n| evaluate multiple expressions from a string.\n\n  note that read-from-string returns two values, the secondary of which is\n  the position from which you could continue to read from the string.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
