Say again?\n\n  others have pointed out that you're the abuser.  I'm gleefully picking up\n  on that, of course, as they are in fact right, but you would never listen\n  to them if I said it first.  I'm happy you're defensive about it, though.\n\n  incidentally, but mostly for the search engines: the full quote is \"you\n  are the kind of moron who needs to be hurt to stop to think\", Joe Kraska.\n  our society punishes destructive morons who have no respect for others.\n  if you are so retarded that you _still_ cannot fathom that this is very\n  different from your nightmarish imagination of what it is, you're also\n  clinically psychotic and probably _unable_ to distinguish reality from\n  your sick imagination.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
