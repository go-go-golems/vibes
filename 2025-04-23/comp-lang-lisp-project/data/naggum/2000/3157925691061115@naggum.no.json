All else being\n| equal most people will choose to work with someone who is friendly and\n| gives them the benefit of the doubt rather than someone who is rude and\n| condescending and makes worst-case assumptions about their motives.\n\n  I'm happy that you, too, consider Marco Antoniotti's response _rude_\n  towards Franz Inc, and that you support my point: if you suspect the\n  worst of motives when you receive a gift from somebody, other people\n  generally don't give you much _more_ for free from then on.\n\n  as for rudeness in this particular case, maybe you just need to learn to\n  live with the fact that people find _you_ rude and _disgusting_ to deal\n  with when you don your halo and fight to save the world from a rudeness\n  you find only when _you_ make worst-case assumptions about the motives of\n  others, but I guess that's OK since you do it, wearing that halo.  I wish\n  you had learned something, but you really learned _nothing_ from the last\n  time we had this discussion.  *sigh*\n\n  and if you are such a champion of benefit of the doubt, consider making\n  some actions of yours conform to your self-serving claims some day.  it\n  would be a little less disgusting to behold a reeking hypocrite actually\n  follow his _own_ advice once in a while, at least.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
