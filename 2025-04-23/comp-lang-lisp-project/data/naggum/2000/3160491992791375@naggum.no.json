Mato Mira\" <matomira@iname.com>\n| I've never seen redundancy as the primary reason ...\n\n  I was referring to an inherent characteristic of human languages, and as\n  such, redundancy is indeed a primary.  indeed, some redundancy is a\n  _good_ thing in human communication.  that is, what might be considered\n  \"redundant\" from a purist point of view is actually necessary to maintain\n  proper communication conduits between people who can't pay 100% attention\n  100% of the time and who most certainly can't cope with 100% of the\n  ramification of every statement 100% of the time.  so we yield to the\n  nature of the human mind instead of removing all forms of redundancy.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
