YOUR WISH HAS BEEN\n  GRANTED!  so why do you continue with the same behavior that caused the\n  label you do not want attached yourself?  we have already established\n  that the best you think you can do in a debate is to count words, for\n  instance.  do as you were told to in the very beginning: try something\n  better, or face the consequences: people will _know_ you can't do better.\n\n  this is not going to stop until you start to behave smart.  this may take\n  a while, but the only goal I have with someone like you in this newsgroup\n  is to make them stop acting in certain ways.  if you are impervious to\n  any sort of outside signal to improve your behavior, it doesn't help what\n  I say or not -- it may in fact hurt you that I don't state my conclusion.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
