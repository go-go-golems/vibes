Is it really so difficult to reply without throwing all\n| your toys out of the pram and getting personal?\n\n  your first line is indeed personal.  my reply to you concerns a matter of\n  fact that is not personal, but relates only to your _actions_.  yes, they\n  are _your_ actions, and if you want to take it personally, you are free\n  to do so for that reason, but you are equally free not to.  how could\n  anyone _not_ take \"some Lisp people get SO UPTIGHT\" as a personal insult?\n  here's another _impersonal_ suggestion: grow a clue before you accuse\n  others of ills you are worse at yourself.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
