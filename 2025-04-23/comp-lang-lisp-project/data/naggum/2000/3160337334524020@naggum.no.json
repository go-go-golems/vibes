It might be well to acquire the habit of not making such\n| accusations lightly.\n\n  so why do you do it so lightly?  are _you_ above the law?  one has to\n  wonder with all the \"what me?  I'm not one of _them!_\"-style rhetorics\n  you serve up, where everything that applies to others could not in your\n  most lively imagination apply to yourself.  in case you wonder, such lack\n  of empathy and principle in judgment is one of the root causes of\n  interminable conflicts, and you're well on your wan to keep this going\n  for nearly four years, just like the other loser does.  stop now.  reel\n  yourself in and start _thinking_.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
