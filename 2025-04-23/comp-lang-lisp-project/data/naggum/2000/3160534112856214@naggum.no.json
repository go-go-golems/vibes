I keep saying that most people are more than smart\n  enough to run their own lives, but few people are smart enough to run the\n  lives of others, even though they are increasingly asked to in this here\n  information society, and on the Net, some people seem to want that more\n  than anything else, especially those who fail to run their own lives.\n\n  I'd have to conclude that you're not even smart enough to be _able_ to\n  run your own life, Janos, and that's why you're trying to imagine mine,\n  but the imagination of a drooling idiot is no match for reality, and\n  you're so ridiculous in your attempt to tell me what your life is like\n  that you're even surpassing Larry Elwood.\n\n  please remember that your imagination is a product of your experiences.\n  it is not always a good idea to broadcast the limits of your imagination.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
