It goes wrong for every use of MASK. Anyway, the\n| patch had to work at that level too, so I had to make sure my changes\n| to defS MASK had the correct effect.\n\n  I'm curious about all this work you're putting in.  have you bothered to\n  alert bugs@franz.com with a test case so they could fix it and you could\n  do something more useful with your life?\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
