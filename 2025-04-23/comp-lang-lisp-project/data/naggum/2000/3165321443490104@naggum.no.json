Say again?\n\n  since this one is so important to you and so important not to _forget_,\n  could you be bothered to actually locate it among what I have said to\n  you?  a message-ID will be very helpful.  a URL at deja.com will work.\n\n  if you find that I have NOT actually said that, you will admit to be a\n  moron, a liar, and a disgusting creep who is out to misrepresent others\n  in such a way as to make others look bad when in fact you are a piece of\n  reeking, self-victimizing crap yourself.\n\n  if you do find that I HAVE actually said that, I'll admit to being a\n  psychopathic abuser who has actually been out to destroy your sterling\n  reputation as a genius within BBN for no good reason.\n\n  do we have a deal, Joe \"Courageous\" Kraska?\n\n  I believe \"very revealing\" are extremely interesting words from our\n  supposed \"victim\".  the psychology of most victims is that the world\n  consists of abusers and victims, and if you aren't a victim, you are an\n  abuser.  the _fact_, however, is that every abuser is a victim and every\n  victim is an abuser.  the question is towards and with whom they have\n  their respective roles.  those who do not subscribe to this set of roles,\n  are actually neither abusers _nor_ victims.\n\n  so, what will your search _reveal_, Joe \"Victim\" Kraska?\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
