Cooper\" <dcooper8@genworks.com>\n| Now I am wondering if there is a way to use this or a similar directive\n| to put something before all but the first element in the list, as in:\n:\n| that is, I want an extra space *before* all but the *first*  element in\n| the argument list, so that the rest of the elements line up under the\n| first one which has a parenthesis to the left of it.\n\n  PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK can handle this requirement easily.  its FORMAT\n  interface is documented in section 22.3.5.2 of the standard.\n\n  for a list like (one two three) to be formatted nicely, this suffices:\n\n(format nil \"~:<~@{~S~^~:@_~}~:>\" '(one two three))\n\n  untangling this example is left as an exercise for the reader...\n  \n#:Erik\n\n",
