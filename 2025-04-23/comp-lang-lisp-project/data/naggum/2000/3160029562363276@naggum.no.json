FIND, POSITION, SEARCH, CHAR, SUBSEQ, etc.\n\n  note that most operations on characters and strings in Common Lisp are\n  simply special cases of operations on elements and sequences.  many\n  C-based programmers are frustrated because they think that Common Lisp\n  has few string-handling functions.  Common Lisp has few string-only\n  functions, so remember to look for sequence and array functions, too.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
