I tend to be puzzled when I meet people who don't\n  reflect on their language, because it's hard to tell which part of the\n  many meanings they got and which they completely missed out on.\n\n| In any event, who cares if the recipient isn't receptive?\n\n  you do, when you take the role of a bystander and raise the discussion to\n  a meta-level.  others do, when they are in middle of the discussion that\n  started it all.  many find it very annoying to see recurring dimwits fail\n  to get over a personal hangup or their desperately trying to recover\n  something they are the only ones to remember they lost.\n\n  newsgroup volume is a measure of discontent.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
