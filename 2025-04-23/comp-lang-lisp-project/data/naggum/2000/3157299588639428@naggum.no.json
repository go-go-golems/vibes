I think I am not\n| going to.\n\n  being able to handle information productively when it runs counter to\n  one's existing beliefs is perhaps the defining attribute of an operative\n  intelligence, since it defines how we deal with information from which we\n  can either learn or recoil, if we don't ignore it as \"not grasped\".\n\n  there is ample evidence that you lack this defining attribute and there\n  are few redeeming qualities to your many _really_ stupid postings in this\n  newsgroup.  had you actually been interested in the topic at hand, you\n  would also have been willing to learn whatever was learnable here -- yet\n  this is where you fail miserable, evidently on _purpose_.\n\n  I wonder why people even bother to reply to you with anything technically\n  useful that you are clearly _unwilling_ to grasp unless you already agree\n  with it, in which case you insult people for being naive.\n\n  please, go annoy people someplace else with your breathtaking stupidity.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
