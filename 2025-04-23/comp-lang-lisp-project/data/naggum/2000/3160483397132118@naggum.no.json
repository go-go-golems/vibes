But this is even good for\n| you as those who do not know what you have done to me, believe that I am\n| an idiot (I hope they are not right).\n\n  precisely, being malicious on purpose is actually seen as constructive to\n  your personal needs and goals.  I'm impressed.  yes, you _are_ an idiot,\n  and your insistence on proving it is your own personal problem, not mine.\n  you could just quit, you know.  it is better to keep quiet and be thought\n  a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
