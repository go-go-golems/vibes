Politics often prevents such\n| proposals from being adopted.  That's why they tend to be rare, and also\n| why it is entirely justified to ask the question.\n\n  well, if they tend to be rare, I'd have expected some _justification_ for\n  the implicit expectation that this was one of those rare cases.\n\n  however, to zoom out a bit, if people in the Common Lisp community wonder\n  why there's so (comparatively) little communal development activity, do\n  consider the responses received to the work that _is_ being done when it\n  is published.  as far as I have seen, the response is generally \"thanks.\n  now where's the rest?\", no matter how much you do.  it almost sounds like\n  a Norwegian tax collector, one of nature's strongest de-motivating forces.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
