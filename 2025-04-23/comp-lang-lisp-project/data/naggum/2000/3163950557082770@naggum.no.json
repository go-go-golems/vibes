I'd love to be proved wrong on this one, though.  Or even if I\n| am right, maybe there is a more natural way to attack the problem?\n\n  apart from actually working, what's wrong with this example?\n\n(defstruct display\n  x y)\n\n(defun global-pointer-position (object)\n  (values (display-x object) (display-y object)))\n\n(defsetf global-pointer-position (object) (new-x new-y)\n  `(setf (display-x ,object) ,new-x\n\t (display-y ,object) ,new-y))\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
