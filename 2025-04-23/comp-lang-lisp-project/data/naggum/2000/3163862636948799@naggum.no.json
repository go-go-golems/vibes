Burson\n| I would additionally suggest going a bit further and making a package\n| that contains *only* the symbols you will need to read.  This will limit\n| what the incoming forms can do when EVALed... which would make me a lot\n| more comfortable with this design.\n\n  it's even a little worse than you sketch out.  ideally, you should be\n  able to force intern not to intern, i.e. to have read call find-symbol\n  and barf on uninterned symbols.  ideally, you should be able to force the\n  symbol-reader to barf on _any_ package specification other than those you\n  have specified.  neither of these are possible in fully conforming code.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
