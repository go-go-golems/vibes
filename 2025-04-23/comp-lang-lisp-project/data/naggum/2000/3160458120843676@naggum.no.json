He is indeed twisting the thruth at the border of\n| malice.  I don't see why referring to _all_ of Zachary's posts were\n| necessary to establish this.\n\n  since you're clearly engaging in the same practices you criticize, what's\n  your problem?  did I merely fail to ask _you_ permission to do what you\n  consider OK when you do it yourself?\n\n  I sincerely wish people who want to criticize others wouldn't be so\n  interminably stupid as to do exactly the same thing themselves.  it\n  doesn't invalidate any criticism per se, but it makes me wonder whether\n  the real issue they have is that _I_ do whatever, not whatever it was I\n  did, in which case I will summarily dismiss them as raving lunatics with\n  a personal axe to grind.\n\n  just don't do what you don't want others to do.  how hard can the merit\n  of this principle be for people to grasp?\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
