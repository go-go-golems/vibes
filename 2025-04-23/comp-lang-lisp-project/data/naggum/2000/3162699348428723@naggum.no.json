I have\n| added the following to ~/.clinit.cl:\n| \n| (setf (logical-pathname-translations \"clocc\")\n|       '((\"**;*.*.*\" \"/home/paolo/projects/clocc/\")\n|         (\";**;*.*.*\" \"/home/paolo/projects/clocc/\")))\n\n  although this works, you should really have matching wildcards in the\n  translation:\n\n(setf (logical-pathname-translations \"clocc\")\n  '((\"**;*.*.*\" \"/home/paolo/projects/clocc/**/*.*\")\n    (\";**;*.*.*\" \"/home/paolo/projects/clocc/**/*.*\")))\n\n  this yields the same results as the ones you have in Allegro CL, but they\n  may work better in the other CLs, too.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
