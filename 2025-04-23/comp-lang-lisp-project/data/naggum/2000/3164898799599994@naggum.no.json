  "content": "\nSubject: Re: Deep copy in lisp: how?\nFrom: Erik Naggum <erik@naggum.no>\nDate: 2000/04/16\nNewsgroups: comp.lang.lisp\nMessage-ID: <3164898799599994@naggum.no>\n\n* Courageous <jkraska1@san.rr.com>\n| You're complaining about *me* making matters personal.\n| Oh, that's rich. Between the two of us, who's posting\n| page-long diatribes sometimes filled with profanity?\n\n  well, here's the clue: _you_ take it personally.  _you_ cannot even\n  imagine that it _isn't_ personal, but that's _your_ choice.  you don't\n  have to make this choice.  so make another choice if you aren't satisfied\n  with it.  if you _are_ satisfied with your choice, and still complain,\n  you do in fact merit the personal insults and the label \"moron\" and much,\n  much more and much, much worse assessments of your mental state.\n\n| Says he who fills up pages with insults & profanity...\n\n  obviously, _you_ have a personal problem with what _you_ think is insults\n  and profanity because your wiener brain makes you see _nothing_ else if\n  this trigger is fired within you.  this is not somebody else's problem.\n  so just _deal_ with it if you don't like its consequences for you.\n\n  I take it that you are happy with your choice to take negative comments\n  personally and as destructively for yourself as possible, and so want\n  others to stop making negative comments that you could take personally.\n  face that facts, moron: that's not going to happen when you post as much\n  evidence of stupidity as you do.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
