Gibson, Architect\" <Frederick@gibson-design.com>\n| I'm working on a CLOS classification system and I'd like to add a time stamp\n| to objects as I create them.  Does anyone know of any public domain time\n| functions that can read the internal clock and output with date and time?\n\n  I'm still working on the code to accompany the paper I gave at LUGM, but\n  it is in production use with a client: http://www.naggum.no/lugm-time.html.\n\n  I expect it to be ready for publication in the not too distant future.\n  let me know if you're a willing test subject.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
