I'd just go ahead and store double-floats.\n\n| Hopefully the relative lack of discussions on compiler-macrolet is not an\n| indication that it is an esoteric facility that should be avoided.  It\n| looks wonderful to me, provided I can make it work.\n\n  it is indeed a useful facility, but it helps a lot to be able to access\n  the declarations and (other) type information (inferences) in the\n  environment it is expanded.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
