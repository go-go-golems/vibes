  "content": "\nSubject: Re: Are there any LISP development systems that are VC, or other GUI    IDE  like?\nFrom: Erik Naggum <erik@naggum.no>\nDate: 2000/02/17\nNewsgroups: comp.lang.lisp\nMessage-ID: <3159810718604997@naggum.no>\n\n* Kenneth P. Turvey\n| Erik regularly treats people this way.  I wonder how many people have\n| really stopped using this group because of his rants...  \n\n  well, since you appear to wonder, the answer is simple: my influence on\n  such is much less than the rate of readers who succumb to accidents.\n\n  however, it is a well-known fact that idiots on the Net drive out people\n  who have something to contribute, in very large numbers.  I'm but a very\n  mild counter-force to that overpowering drive in society to dumb down\n  everything by telling people they have \"rights\" to post their drooling\n  idiocy everywhere, and in particular that only those who criticize the\n  idiots should have no right to do so.\n\n  I do wonder, however, why it is better to be preoccupied with _people_\n  than to be preoccupied with principles and ideas and actions, and why it\n  is OK to post inane drivel about people in articles with zero technical\n  merit or even contents, but not OK to flame morons _in_ technical areas.\n  I wish sometimes that those who have such a dramatic need to discuss _me_\n  would at least be \"kind\" enough to form a fan club or something equally\n  disgusting instead of pretending they are caring about anything more\n  intelligent than the personal nonsense we see in the National Enquirer.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
