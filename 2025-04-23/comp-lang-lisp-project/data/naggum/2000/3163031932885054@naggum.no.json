Linux systems are very well supported by Lisp systems.\n  which Linux are you using?  if you are using the programmers' favorite\n  distribution, Debian GNU/Linux, you can install CLISP and CMUCL with the\n  package system, and Franz Inc offers a trial edition for Linux that you\n  basically download and install.\n\n| But I guess that I shall be able to program lisp in Emacs, right?\n\n  you will, but Emacs Lisp is a _really_ ancient dialect of Lisp, with lots\n  of interesting stuff missing.  the modern Lisp is Common Lisp.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
