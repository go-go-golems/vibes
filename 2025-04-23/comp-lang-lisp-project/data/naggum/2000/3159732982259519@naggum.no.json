  "content": "\nSubject: Re: Are there any LISP development systems that are VC, or other GUI    IDE  like?\nFrom: Erik Naggum <erik@naggum.no>\nDate: 2000/02/16\nNewsgroups: comp.lang.lisp\nMessage-ID: <3159732982259519@naggum.no>\n\n* Robert Posey <muddy@raytheon.com>\n| However, at my company you can be sure that they will be gone soon.\n\n  so this really boils down to your still working at a place that is deeply\n  dissatisfying to you, but it serves your personal needs better to blame\n  Emacs (and/or Common Lisp) than to get out of your miserable situation.\n\n  over the years, we have had a lot of people like you in comp.lang.lisp\n  and the Emacs newsgroups.  I guess this is so because people think it's\n  OK to blame these tools, but not OK to blame some other tools (such as\n  Microsoft's cruftware), for the simple reason that being miserable in the\n  majority makes people feel a lot _safer_ than being in a small minority\n  (whether one would be miserable there or not).  I do my very best to make\n  people feel unsafe and a lot more miserable in the majority, so it shall\n  appear, if not be, safer and better to be in the minority, instead.\n\n  your apologia for remaining at a miserable place are unconvincing at best.\n\n  go fix your _real_ problem, OK?\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
