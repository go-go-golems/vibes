I actually find such arguments very\n  insulting.  if you make this kind of argument with, say, black Americans,\n  whom you assume don't understand a word because they're black, you're a\n  racist.  it makes no difference to me if you make it about foreigners or\n  other groups about which you know very little that applies to individuals.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
