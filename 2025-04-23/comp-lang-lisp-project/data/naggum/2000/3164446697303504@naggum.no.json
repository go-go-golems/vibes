Did you read it? No. Foo on you for that.\n\n  this is just great.  of course I did that, and that's _why_ I criticize\n  you for not doing it UP FRONT.  perhaps you do ont know what \"UP FRONT\"\n  means?  well, it means you do it at the very start of your request for\n  help.  sort of like \"I use XLISP, and have this problem\" instead of just\n  asking people to guess based on the lack of intelligibility of the\n  problem as stated in the environments smart people use.\n\n  please go back to C++, both communities would benefit from that.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
