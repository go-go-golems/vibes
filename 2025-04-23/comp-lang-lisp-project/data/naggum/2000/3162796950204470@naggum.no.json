Well, I didn't mean to cause you such\n| emotional distress by teaching you remedial programming.  Guess I must\n| have accidentally struck a nerve.  Really sorry, hope you recover.\n\n  you think you have been teaching me remedial programming?\n  that's, like, amazing.  you really _are_ quite nuts.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
