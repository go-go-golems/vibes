When you behave the way you have, certain social consequences are\n| part of the natural order of things.  Contemplate it.\n\n  so you _do_ realize that!  but of course, it applies only to other people\n  and you're exempt from the rules that apply to other people, aren't you?\n\n  focus on _yourself_.  care about _yourself_.  let other people focus on\n  themselves and care about themselves.  get off the \"getting personal\"\n  track and focus on _your_ needs, discuss matters that matter to _you_,\n  and learn what you came to learn, if you _did_ come to learn anything\n  instead of merely posturing as a moron with an agenda.  by continuing to\n  taking this so _personally_ you display a personal insecurity that is\n  disgusting to behold and which is of no value to anyone to know about in\n  the first place.  \"contemplate it.\"\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
