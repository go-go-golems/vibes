I don't appreciate your line of\n  psychologizing crap, but now that you get it back in your face, I see\n  that you are a lot more sensitive to the matter than I am, which is good,\n  because you may realize that if you plan to win any games that way, you\n  won't do it here, and you're clearly the kind of moron who needs to be\n  hurt to stop to think.  will _that_ make you stick to your issues,\n  whatever they may be, or will you smear more of your personality all over\n  the place with yet more moronic psychologizing and irrelevant personal\n  attacks?  it's your call, \"Courageous\".\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
