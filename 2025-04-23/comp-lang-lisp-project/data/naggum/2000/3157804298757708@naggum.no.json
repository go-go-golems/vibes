I'm trying to tell him (and now you),\n  that you have to _listen_ to what people are saying, not just react to\n  what _you_ feel.  please heed my advice, or heed my secondary advice:\n  shut up if you have nothing to contribute.\n\n| I think Dirt should be welcome on the net.\n\n  your implication that somebody thinks he is not is insulting.  quit it.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
