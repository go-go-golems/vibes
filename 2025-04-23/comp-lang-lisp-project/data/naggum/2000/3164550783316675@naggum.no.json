Some of us do, in fact, work on real problems which need\n| solving.  Theoretical constraints are interesting and valuable to know,\n| but the project moves on.\n\n  just because you cannot fathom the theoretical implications of your\n  questions does not mean that those who do don't solve practical problems.\n  think about this.  please.\n\n  and, incidentally, if I have \"made\" you feel like an idiot, why not just\n  do something that would put such impressions to _shame_ instead of going\n  out of your way to _prove_ that you really _are_ hopelessly lost?\n\n| I suspect that you need to look inward and not outward to solve the\n| problem that you need to work on. Usenet won't offer your ego what it's\n| looking for, no matter how hard you look for it.\n\n  I'm sure you and your shrink have worked something out that works for you\n  (although by the looks of it, you have some ways to go), but just like he\n  or she should have told you that you shouldn't give other people your\n  medication, you also shouldn't believe that your personal problems apply\n  to other people.\n\n  but I'll give you this: you are indeed courageous.  I know of few other\n  people who would expose themselves the way you do.  here's a hint: you\n  really don't need to -- nobody cares about _you_, personally, and it's an\n  affront to your audience, _any_ audience, to think they do.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
