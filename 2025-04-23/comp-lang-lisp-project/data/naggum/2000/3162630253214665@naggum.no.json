It means \"In my experience\".  TLA means\n| \"three letter acronym\", a term I'm abusing slitely here.  \n\n  you just spent two whole lines explaining your \"optimized\" writing style!\n  I'm sorry, Tom, but I find this positively hilarious, to the point where\n  it has removed any credibility to your ridiculous points about optimizing.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
