And I'm wondering if a more experienced programmer can comment\n| on whether this is a common data structure with a common name.\n\n  looks like a sorted association list to me.\n\n(assoc 50.0 '((10.0 . \"this stuff\")\n\t      (40.0 . \"this other stuff\")\n\t      (100.0 . \"yet some other stuff\"))\n       :test #'<=)\n=> (100.0 . \"yet some other stuff\")\n\n  FIND would allow you to use a sequence of more complex objects and use\n  :KEY to extract the slot you want to look at.\n\n  in any case, I would expect such a function to be called FIND-foo, foo\n  being the object you're looking for.  whether you implement it as a\n  general function traversing a list or a function with a fast TYPECASE\n  dispatch on ranges is largely immaterial, though.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
