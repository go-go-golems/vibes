I\n| knew immediately that I was defenseless against you as I am still sticking\n| to my 19th century ideals of tolerance and freedom of thought and decency\n| above all.\n\n  ... which apparently includes being purely malicious as the sole purpose.\n  it doesn't to me, and I never am.  it does not cease to amaze me that\n  some people suddenly relinquish all concepts of ethics once they have\n  found an excuse -- but that's the evidence I need of their being evil.\n\n  if you haven't even figured out that I respond to something people _do_\n  and quit when they no longer do it, not to who they _are_ (and don't quit\n  after they don't bug me anymore, quite fundamentally unlike you, which I\n  don't respond to unless you openly attack me), you're even more of a\n  drooling idiot than I had feared you _could_ be -- I thought so low IQs\n  were flushed out as spontanous abortions.\n\n  next time you wish to pretend to be upholding \"decency\", please let it\n  include \"not lying through your teeth\".  you are the most _indecent_ punk\n  who has been on this newsgroup in all its history, far exceeding anything\n  I could ever imagine doing.\n\n#:Erik\n\n",
