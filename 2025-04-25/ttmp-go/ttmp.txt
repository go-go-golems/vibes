# WriteHERE: Heterogeneous Recursive Planning Architecture Report

This document provides a detailed overview of the WriteHERE codebase architecture, explaining how the various components interact and the control flow through the system.

## 1. System Overview

WriteHERE is an AI-based writing framework that employs a hierarchical recursive planning approach for generating long-form content. The system stands out by implementing:

1. **Recursive Planning**: Breaking down complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks
2. **Heterogeneous Integration**: Combining different task types (retrieval, reasoning, composition)
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjusting the writing process in real-time

The codebase is organized into a modular structure with clear separation between the core engine, the backend API server, and the frontend visualization.

## 2. Repository Structure

# WriteHERE: Data Types and Storage Implementation

This document examines the data structures, storage mechanisms, and persistence systems used in the WriteHERE framework, with a focus on the backend implementation.

## 1. Core Data Structures

### 1.1 Task Graph Structure

The task graph is the central data structure in WriteHERE, implemented in `recursive/graph.py`:

```
Graph
├── graph_edges: Dict[str, List[Node]]  # Maps node IDs to child nodes
├── nid_list: List[str]                 # List of all node IDs
├── node_list: List[Node]               # List of all node objects
├── topological_task_queue: List[Node]  # Nodes in execution order
└── outer_node: Node                    # Reference to parent node
```

The graph implements a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure where:

# WriteHERE: Backend API and Frontend Structure

This document provides a detailed analysis of the API architecture and frontend implementation of the WriteHERE system, focusing on communication patterns, state management, visualization techniques, and user controls.

## 1. Backend API Architecture

### 1.1 API Server Implementation

The WriteHERE backend API is implemented using Flask (`backend/server.py`) and exposes both RESTful endpoints and WebSocket connections for real-time updates. The API serves as a bridge between the frontend and the core engine, handling task management, execution, and reporting.

Key components of the backend API:
- **Flask REST API**: Handles standard HTTP requests
- **Flask-SocketIO**: Provides real-time bidirectional event-based communication
- **Task Queue Management**: Maintains state of running and completed tasks
- **File System Integration**: Persists and retrieves task data from the filesystem

# WriteHERE: Proposed Neo4j-Based and Event-Driven Architecture

*Transforming a monolithic content generation system into a scalable, resilient, distributed architecture*

Imagine a writing assistant that not only generates content but reveals its entire thinking process, breaking down complex writing tasks into manageable steps, researching topics, analyzing information, and crafting prose—all visible to you in real-time. This is WriteHERE, a sophisticated AI writing framework that employs hierarchical recursive planning to create long-form content. 

However, as with many successful systems that evolve from research prototypes to production applications, WriteHERE faces architectural limitations that hinder its growth. This document outlines an ambitious yet practical proposal to transform WriteHERE from its current file-based, monolithic architecture to a scalable, distributed system powered by Neo4j graph database and event-driven principles.

This transformation isn't merely a technical refactoring—it's a reimagining of how AI writing systems can scale to enterprise needs while maintaining the transparency and recursive planning that makes WriteHERE uniquely powerful.

## 1. Limitations of Current Architecture

The current WriteHERE implementation has served admirably as a proof-of-concept and small-scale production system. However, as usage grows and requirements evolve, several architectural constraints have emerged that limit its potential:

### 1.1 File-based Persistence: The Serialization Bottleneck

At the heart of WriteHERE lies a sophisticated task graph that represents the writing process. Currently, this graph is persisted through Python's pickle serialization and JSON files:

# Current persistence approach in GraphRunEngine.save()

# WriteHERE Recursive Engine Debugging Guide

## Introduction: Understanding WriteHERE's Architecture

WriteHERE is a sophisticated recursive task planning and execution framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to decompose complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks. At its core, the system implements a hierarchical state machine where tasks are represented as nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with execution governed by state transitions and agent-based processing.

Unlike simpler LLM frameworks that use a single prompt for generation, WriteHERE employs a recursive decomposition strategy that mirrors how human writers plan and execute complex documents:

1. First breaking down a large writing task into logical sections
2. Then decomposing sections into specific research, reasoning, and writing tasks
3. Finally executing atomic tasks and synthesizing results upward

This guide is designed to help you understand this complex system by setting strategic breakpoints that reveal the internal mechanics during runtime. As you debug, you'll gain insights into how this recursive planning approach enables LLMs to produce more coherent, well-structured documents than simple prompt-based generation.

## The Big Picture: Tasks, Graphs, and Agents

Before diving into specific breakpoints, let's understand the core components:

1. **Node System**: Each writing task is represented as a `Node` in a graph structure. Nodes have:

# WriteHERE: Go Backend Porting Plan

This document outlines the plan and architecture for porting the WriteHERE Python Flask backend server (`backend/server.py`) to Go. The goal is to create a robust, performant, and maintainable backend service using idiomatic Go practices and standard libraries.

## 1. Introduction

The existing backend server provides a REST API and WebSocket interface to manage and monitor the core recursive writing engine. The Go port aims to replicate this functionality, initially with mocked engine interactions, paving the way for integrating the actual Go engine port later.

**Key Technologies:**

- **Language:** Go
- **CLI Framework:** `github.com/spf13/cobra`
- **Logging:** `github.com/rs/zerolog`
- **HTTP Framework:** `github.com/gin-gonic/gin`
- **WebSocket:** `github.com/gorilla/websocket`
- **UUIDs:** `github.com/google/uuid`

# Recursive Engine Architecture: A Comprehensive Technical Analysis

## Overview

The Recursive Engine is a sophisticated system designed for orchestrating complex AI-powered content generation tasks such as story writing and report generation. It employs a hierarchical task decomposition approach with a graph-based execution model, combined with an LLM-powered agent system to handle different aspects of the content creation process. The architecture follows a clear separation of concerns between task management, execution, agent interaction, and memory management.

# Event-Driven Architecture for the Recursive Engine

## 1. Introduction

This document proposes an event-driven, asynchronous architecture for the Recursive Engine, designed for scalability, resilience, and modularity. Instead of a central engine managing a stateful graph in memory and sequentially stepping through nodes, this architecture relies on independent services communicating via events over a message bus. Tasks are processed asynchronously as their dependencies are met and resources become available.

### 1.2 Design Philosophy

The proposed architecture follows several key principles:

- **Microservices Orientation**: Break down the monolith into focused, independently deployable services.
- **Event-First Communication**: Services communicate primarily through events, reducing tight coupling.
- **Stateless Workers**: Processing logic is contained in stateless workers that can scale horizontally.
- **Persistent State**: Task state is stored in a durable database rather than in-memory.
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Task dependencies are explicitly modeled and tracked.
- **Scalable Processing**: Allow concurrent execution where dependencies permit.

## 2. Core Concepts

- **Events:** Atomic pieces of information representing significant state changes or requests (e.g., `TaskSubmitted`, `TaskCompleted`, `SubtasksPlanned`).

# WriteHERE Go Event-Driven Port: Status and Next Steps

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the progress made in porting the core WriteHERE engine from its original Python implementation to a new event-driven architecture written in Go. The goal of this port is to leverage Go's concurrency, performance, and strong typing to create a more scalable, resilient, and maintainable system based on the principles outlined in `ttmp/2025-04-08/03-event-driven-architecture.md`.

This document serves as a handover guide for developers joining the project, explaining what has been built, the key architectural decisions made, and the immediate next steps required to continue development.

## 2. Accomplishments So Far (Phase 1, 2 & 3 Started)

We have implemented the foundational infrastructure (Phase 1) and begun work on the Scheduler Framework (Phase 2) and Action System (Phase 3):

- **Project Setup & Core Packages (Phase 1):**
  - Go module (`github.com/go-go-golems/writehere-go`), directory structure.
  - `pkg/events`: Event definitions (`TaskSubmitted`, `TaskReady`, `TaskAssigned`, `TaskStarted`, `TaskCompleted`, `TaskFailed`, `SubtasksPlanned`), `EventBus` (Watermill/GoChannel).
  - `pkg/state`: `Task` model (with `RUNNING` status), `Store` interface, `InMemoryStore`, `StateService` (handles `TaskSubmitted`, `TaskCompleted`, `TaskFailed`, `TaskStarted`, `SubtasksPlanned`).
  - `cmd/engine-api`: API gateway (`POST /tasks`, `GET /tasks/{id}`, `GET /tasks/root/{root_id}`).
- **Scheduler Framework (Phase 2):**
  - `pkg/scheduler`: `Service` subscribes to `TaskReady`, determines worker type, publishes `TaskAssigned`.
  - `pkg/workers/planning`: Stubbed `Service` subscribes to `TaskAssigned`, filters for `planning-worker`, publishes `TaskStarted`, generates _dummy_ subtasks, publishes `SubtasksPlanned`, then publishes `TaskCompleted`.

# Debugging Guide: WriteHERE Recursive Engine

## 1. Introduction: The Bigger Picture

**What is WriteHERE?**

WriteHERE is a framework designed for complex, multi-step writing tasks like generating detailed reports or stories. It aims to automate the process by breaking down a high-level goal (e.g., "Write a report on AI advancements in 2024") into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.

**What is the `recursive` Engine?**

The `recursive` directory contains the core logic engine of WriteHERE. Its primary responsibility is to:

1.  **Plan:** Take an initial writing goal and decompose it into a hierarchical task graph. Nodes in this graph represent specific actions like planning further, writing a section, searching for information, or reasoning about content.
2.  **Execute:** Traverse this task graph according to dependencies and node statuses. For each node, it selects and invokes the appropriate "Agent" (specialized LLM prompts or other tools like web search).
3.  **Manage State:** Keep track of the status of each task (e.g., `READY`, `DOING`, `FINISH`).
4.  **Maintain Context:** Use a `Memory` system to provide relevant information (like previously written text or results from dependencies) to each agent during execution.
5.  **Aggregate Results:** Combine the outputs of individual tasks to produce the final written document.

Essentially, the `recursive` engine orchestrates the complex workflow of generating long-form content by managing a dynamic graph of tasks and leveraging LLMs and other tools via specialized agents. The `backend` directory provides an API layer on top of this engine, but the core execution logic resides here.

# WriteHERE: Report Writing Task-to-Prompt Mapping and Base Type Analysis

## Overview

This document explains how report writing tasks in WriteHERE are mapped to specific prompt templates, and how these prompts are associated with the core base types: **COMPOSITION**, **REASONING**, and **RETRIEVAL**. The analysis is based on the code in `recursive/agent/agents/regular.py`, the prompt implementations in `recursive/agent/prompts/report/`, and the configuration logic in `recursive/engine.py`. It references the overall architecture documentation ([01-write-here-architecture-report.md](../2025-04-07/01-write-here-architecture-report.md), [01-system-overview.md](../step-by-step/01-system-overview.md)).

---

## 1. Task Types and Base Types

WriteHERE organizes all tasks under three base types:

- **COMPOSITION**: Writing tasks ("write")
- **REASONING**: Analytical tasks ("think")
- **RETRIEVAL**: Information gathering/search tasks ("search")

These are mapped in the config as:

# WriteHERE: OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Design for Task Planning & Execution

## 1. Introduction: The Need for Tracing in a Recursive System

WriteHERE employs a sophisticated **hierarchical recursive planning** approach to generate complex content (as detailed in `ttmp/2025-04-07/01-write-here-architecture-report.md`). Unlike simpler frameworks, it decomposes large tasks into a dynamic graph (`recursive/graph.py`) of smaller, potentially heterogeneous sub-tasks (**COMPOSITION**, **REASONING**, **RETRIEVAL**). Each task (`AbstractNode`) progresses through a defined state machine (`TaskStatus`), managed by the `GraphRunEngine` (`recursive/engine.py`).


Crucially, the system dynamically selects specific **agents** and **prompt templates** based on the task's type, its current state (e.g., readiness, need for update), and the specific action being performed (e.g., `plan`, `execute`, `atom` check) as defined in the configuration and outlined in `ttmp/2025-04-14/02-tasks-mapping-planning-report.md`. This involves complex logic within agents like `UpdateAtomPlanningAgent` deciding whether to further decompose a task (recursive planning) or treat it as atomic, and within `get_llm_output` to select and construct the precise prompt for the LLM.

This inherent complexity—recursive decomposition, state-driven execution, dynamic agent/prompt selection, and heterogeneous task handling—makes it challenging to follow the flow of execution simply by reading logs. **Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry becomes essential** to:

- Visualize the dynamic task graph creation and execution flow.
- Understand the decision-making process for task decomposition (planning vs. atomicity).
- Track task scheduling and state transitions based on dependencies.
- Pinpoint how specific prompts are selected and constructed based on context.
- Monitor the interactions with LLMs, including parsing of results.
- Debug issues related to unexpected task states, incorrect prompt usage, or performance bottlenecks.

This document outlines a detailed instrumentation strategy using OpenTelemetry (OTel) focused on providing this visibility into the core components: `recursive/engine.py`, `recursive/graph.py`, and `recursive/agent/agents/regular.py`.

# Recursive Codebase Cleanup Guide (Phase 1: Organization & Naming)

## 1. Introduction

Welcome! This document outlines the first phase of refactoring the `recursive` codebase. The primary goal of this phase is to improve the project's structure for better readability, maintainability, and ease of navigation, especially for new developers. We will focus _only_ on renaming files/directories and splitting overly large or multi-responsibility files. No functional code changes should occur in this phase.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each file should ideally contain one primary class or a set of closely related functions serving a single purpose.
- **Clear Naming:** Filenames and directory names should clearly indicate their contents or purpose. Avoid abbreviations where possible and use standard Python conventions (snake_case for files/modules).
- **Logical Grouping:** Related components (e.g., different LLM clients, specific agent types, utility functions) should be grouped together in directories.
- **Consistency:** Apply naming and organizational patterns consistently across the codebase.

## 3. Directory Structure Changes

No major directory _structure_ changes are planned in this phase, mostly renaming and splitting files _within_ the existing structure (`llm/`, `executor/`, `utils/`, `agent/`, etc.).

Okay, I will create a detailed cleanup plan focusing on file naming and organization for the `recursive` module. This plan will be saved in `ttmp/2025-04-15/01-refactoring-cleanup-guide.md` and is designed for a developer new to this part of the codebase.

This initial phase will *only* involve renaming and moving files/directories. **No code logic will be changed.** As a consequence, Python imports will be broken after completing these steps. Fixing the imports will be a separate, subsequent task.

# Recursive Module: Phase 1 Cleanup Plan (Naming & Organization)

## 1. Introduction

**Goal:** Improve the organization, clarity, and naming consistency of files and directories within the `recursive` Python module.

**Scope:** This initial phase focuses *exclusively* on:
    *   Renaming files and directories for better clarity and consistency (snake_case).
    *   Reorganizing the directory structure for improved modularity.
    *   Consolidating or relocating utility/configuration files.

**Out of Scope (for this phase):**
    *   Changing any Python code logic (functions, classes, methods).

# Guide: Adding Redis Event Streaming to the Recursive Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide for integrating Redis-based event streaming into the `recursive` agent codebase. The goal is to emit events at key points during the agent's execution process (e.g., engine steps, node status changes, LLM calls, tool usage) and publish them to a Redis stream.

This enables real-time monitoring and visualization of the agent's progress, either through log analysis or via a simple web UI connected through a WebSocket server that relays events from Redis.

**Target Audience:** Developers familiar with the `recursive` agent codebase who need to implement or understand the event instrumentation.

**Scope:**

- Defining event types and schemas.
- Identifying locations in the code to emit events.
- Implementing a simple Redis-based event bus.
- Adding event emission calls to `engine.py`, `node/abstract.py`, `agent/base.py`, and `executor/action/action_executor.py`.
- Creating a FastAPI WebSocket server to bridge Redis events to web clients.
- Providing a minimal HTML/JavaScript UI for displaying events.

# Recursive Agent Event Logging System

## Overview

The Recursive Agent Event Logging System provides real-time visibility into the execution of the agent through a Redis-based event streaming architecture. This document describes the system design, event schemas, and instructions for developers who want to build enhanced UI visualizations for monitoring agent runs.

## System Architecture

The event logging system consists of three main components:

1. **Event Bus** (`recursive/utils/event_bus.py`): A Redis-based pub/sub mechanism that handles the emission and delivery of events from the agent to consumers.
2. **Instrumentation Points**: Strategic locations in the codebase where events are emitted to track agent execution.
3. **WebSocket Server** (`recursive/utils/ws_server.py`): A FastAPI server that reads events from Redis and forwards them to connected web clients and serves the React UI.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent Components] -- Publishes --> B(EventBus);
    B -- Pushes (XADD) --> C(Redis Stream: agent_events);
    D[WebSocket Server] -- Reads (XREAD) --> C;
    D -- Sends --> E(WebSocket Clients);

# How-To: Adding Custom Event Visualizations to the Recursive Agent React UI

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a guide for developers on how to extend the existing `ui-react` application for the Recursive Agent Event Logging System. The primary goal is to enable the creation of custom UI components that visualize specific `AgentEvent` types beyond the default table view.

- **Purpose**: To enable richer, more targeted insights into agent behavior by visualizing specific event types (e.g., LLM calls, tool usage, node status changes).
- **Target Audience**: Frontend developers familiar with React, Redux Toolkit (RTK Query), TypeScript, and Bootstrap.
- **Overview**: We will cover the relevant UI architecture, the process of creating a new visualization component, integrating it with the existing Redux state, and styling it using Bootstrap.

This document builds upon the information provided in `ttmp/2025-04-16/04-event-logging-system.md`.

## 2. Requirements and Specifications

### Functional Requirements

- The system must allow developers to create new React components that render data based on specific `AgentEvent` types.
- Custom visualizations should access the live stream of events received via WebSocket.
- Visualizations should integrate smoothly into the existing UI layout.
- Components should handle potential variations or missing data within event payloads gracefully.

# Designing Custom UIs for the WriteHERE Recursive Planning Agent: Event Visualization Guide

## 1. System Context and Purpose

The WriteHERE system is a sophisticated AI-based writing framework that employs hierarchical recursive planning to generate long-form content. This document expands on our existing React UI framework to address the specific visualization needs for monitoring and understanding WriteHERE's internal processes.

### Key System Characteristics

- **Recursive Planning Architecture**: The system decomposes complex writing tasks into nested subtasks organized in a hierarchical task graph
- **Heterogeneous Task Types**: Different nodes in the graph perform specialized functions (composition, retrieval, reasoning)
- **Dynamic Execution Flow**: Tasks execute based on dependencies and status changes, creating a complex execution pattern
- **Multi-Stage Processing**: Each task goes through multiple states (planning, execution, reflection, aggregation)

### Visualization Challenges

- **Complex State Transitions**: Tasks move through multiple states that should be intuitively visualized
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: The nested structure of tasks requires clear representation of parent-child relationships
- **Temporal Patterns**: Understanding when and how long specific operations take is critical for performance analysis
- **Event Volume**: The system generates many events that must be filtered and prioritized for effective monitoring

# Enhancing LLM Event Logging: Step Number and Full Prompt/Response

## 1. Goal

This document details the investigation and proposed changes to enhance the LLM-related events (`llm_call_started`, `llm_call_completed`) emitted by the Recursive Agent system. The goals are:

1.  **Propagate Step Number:** Include the current execution `step` number in the LLM event payloads.
2.  **Include Full Details:** Add the complete `prompt` and `response` content to the corresponding event payloads, removing the current truncation.

Context for this investigation can be found in `ttmp/2025-04-17/04-event-logging-system.md`.

## 2. Investigation

### 2.1. Code Flow Analysis

The relevant code flow for LLM calls starts in the `GraphRunEngine` and proceeds to the `Agent`:

1.  **`recursive/engine.py:forward_one_step_not_parallel`**: This method orchestrates a single execution step. It has access to the current `step` number (passed as an argument). It identifies the `need_next_step_node`. **This is the source of the `step` number.**
2.  **`recursive/node/abstract.py:AbstractNode.next_action_step`**: The engine calls this method on the selected node. This method determines the appropriate action based on the node's status and calls `do_action`.
3.  **`recursive/node/abstract.py:AbstractNode.do_action`**: This method invokes the appropriate agent method (e.g., `plan`, `execute`) via the `AgentProxy`.

# Design: Finding and Displaying Related Events

## 1. Introduction

This document explores design ideas for implementing a feature in the event monitoring UI where selecting an event (e.g., in a table row) opens a modal displaying other events considered "related" to the selected one. The goal is to provide users with contextual information surrounding a specific event, aiding debugging and understanding the agent's execution flow.

We will examine different ways to define event "relatedness" based on the existing event schema (see `ttmp/2025-04-17/04-long-term-document--event-logging-system.md`) and propose logic for identifying and presenting these related events.

## 2. Defining Event "Relatedness"

Given the structure of the events and the agent's execution model, several criteria can be used to determine if two events are related. Here are some potential definitions:

**a) By Node ID (`node_id`)**

- **Rationale:** Events often pertain to the lifecycle or actions performed for a specific task node within the agent's execution graph. Grouping by `node_id` connects all activities associated with that single task.
- **Logic:** Given a selected event `E` with `payload.node_id`, find all other events `E'` where `E'.payload.node_id == E.payload.node_id`.
- **Scope:** Connects status changes, LLM calls, and tool usage for a specific task.
- **Applicability:** Applies to most event types (`step_started`, `step_finished`, `node_status_changed`, `llm_call_*`, `tool_*`).

**b) By Step Number (`step`)**

# React Event Modal Implementation Guide

## Introduction

The Recursive Agent Event Logging System provides real-time visibility into the execution of the agent through a Redis-based event streaming architecture. This guide focuses on the UI component that displays detailed information about individual events through a modal interface with tabbed content.

This document serves as a comprehensive tutorial for developers who want to understand, maintain, or extend the event modal functionality in the React UI. We'll cover architecture, implementation details, and provide examples for adding new tabs and adapting the modal for new event types.

## Architecture Overview

### Event Monitoring System

Before diving into the modal implementation, it's important to understand the broader event monitoring system:

1. **Event Generation**: The agent emits events during execution (e.g., `step_started`, `llm_call_completed`)
2. **Event Streaming**: Events are published to Redis and read by the WebSocket server
3. **WebSocket API**: The client connects to a WebSocket endpoint to receive events in real-time
4. **React UI**: Events are displayed in a table and can be inspected in detail via the modal

### Modal Component Architecture

# Summary and Next Steps: Event Context Propagation (2025-04-17)

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The primary goal of our recent work was to ensure the `ExecutionContext` object, specifically containing the current execution `step` number, is correctly propagated throughout the agent's execution flow. This is crucial for accurately logging the step number in certain events (`node_status_changed`, `llm_call_started`, `llm_call_completed`) emitted via the `EventBus`, providing better context for monitoring and debugging agent runs. The scope involved modifying event emitters and key methods involved in the execution loop and node status updates.

## 2. Accomplishments So Far

We have successfully modified several key files to handle and pass the `ExecutionContext` (`ctx`) object:

- **`recursive/utils/event_bus.py`**:
  - Modified `emit_node_status_changed`, `emit_llm_call_started`, and `emit_llm_call_completed` functions.
  - These functions now accept an optional `ctx: ExecutionContext` argument instead of `step: Optional[int]`.
  - They internally extract the `step` number from `ctx` if provided, defaulting to `None` otherwise.
  - Fixed linter errors by adding null checks for `redis_client` in the `publish` method.
- **`recursive/node/abstract.py`**:
  - Modified `AbstractNode.do_exam` to accept `ctx: Optional[ExecutionContext]` parameter and pass it to `emit_node_status_changed`.
  - Modified `AbstractNode.next_action_step` to pass the received `ctx` to its internal calls to `self.do_exam`. _(Note: The applied edit differed slightly from the initial instruction but achieved the goal of passing `ctx` to `do_exam` when the node status changes within `next_action_step` itself)._
  - Fixed linter errors by adding `Tuple` to the imports from `typing`.
- **`recursive/agent/base.py`**:

# React Event Modal Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the event visualization system in our agent monitoring UI, with specific focus on the implementation of modal dialogs that display detailed information about agent events. The event system visualizes the execution flow of our recursive agent architecture through a real-time event stream displayed in a tabular format, with the ability to view detailed information about each event in modal dialogs.

The target audience for this guide includes frontend developers who are working on enhancing the agent monitoring UI, particularly those who need to implement new modal views for different event types or extend the existing modal functionality.

## Architecture Overview

### Event Visualization System Architecture

The event visualization system follows a data flow architecture where agent events are emitted from the backend, stored in Redis, and streamed to the frontend through WebSockets. The frontend components then process and display these events to users.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent Components] -- "Emit Events" --> B[Redis Stream]
    B -- "Stream Events" --> C[WebSocket Server]
    C -- "Forward Events" --> D[React Frontend]

# Brainstorm: Potential Node/Graph Event Types

Based on analysis of `recursive/node/abstract.py` and `recursive/graph.py`, here are potential new event types to provide more granular tracking of the task graph lifecycle beyond just `node_status_changed`.

## Potential New Event Types

### 1. `node_created`

- **Description**: Emitted when a new `AbstractNode` instance is initialized, typically within the `plan2graph` method of its outer node, or at the start for the root node.
- **Potential Emission Point**: End of `AbstractNode.__init__()`.
- **Purpose**: Track the creation of individual task nodes, capturing their initial configuration and position in the hierarchy.
- **Potential Payload**:
  ```json
  {
    "event_type": "node_created",
    "payload": {
      "node_id": "new-node-uuid-string", // The hashkey
      "node_nid": "1.2", // The human-readable NID
      "node_type": "PLAN_NODE" | "EXECUTE_NODE",
      "task_type": "COMPOSITION" | "REASONING" | "RETRIEVAL",

# How-To: Implement Node and Graph Lifecycle Events

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose and Value

This document guides developers on implementing new event types within the Recursive Agent's event logging system. The existing system primarily tracks high-level step execution, LLM calls, tool usage, and node status changes. While valuable, it lacks detailed insight into the dynamic construction and evolution of the internal task graphs generated during planning.

Adding events specifically for node creation, planning, graph building, and result availability provides much finer-grained visibility. This enables:

- Real-time visualization of how task graphs are constructed and modified.
- Better debugging by tracing the exact sequence of node/edge additions.
- Detailed analysis of the planning process itself.
- Richer UI representations that dynamically build the graph structure as it happens.

### Target Audience

This guide is intended for developers working on:

- The core agent execution logic (`recursive/engine.py`, `recursive/node/`, `recursive/graph.py`).

# Streaming Node Changes → Building a Graph Store in Redux Toolkit

_A comprehensive guide to creating a real-time, normalized graph store that syncs automatically with your WebSocket event stream_

## 1. Why Create a Dedicated Graph Slice?

Your event list in `eventsApi` serves as an append-only log - perfect for audit trails and history UIs. However, components that need the current graph state (visualizations, progress bars, critical-path calculations) shouldn't have to replay that entire log on every render.

A dedicated graph slice offers several key advantages:

- **O(1) Lookup Performance**: Get nodes and relationships instantly by ID instead of scanning through event arrays
- **Cleaner Separation of Concerns**: Keep your event log as an immutable audit trail while using the graph slice as an in-memory database for views
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Updates to the graph state happen directly in the WebSocket message handler, with no additional middleware required

**RTK concept**: Multiple slices can coexist in the same store, each handling distinct responsibilities. This follows Redux Toolkit's "single-source-of-truth" principle while optimizing for different access patterns.

## 2. Designing a Normalized Data Model with Entity Adapters

Below is a “drop‑in” guide that shows how to bolt your **normalized Redux graph slice** onto the **Reaflow** canvas, *reuse* the custom‑styled node prototype you already built, and keep the diagram in‑sync with the live WebSocket stream.

# Server-Side Graph State Management and UI Synchronization

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding server-side graph state management to the WebSocket server and synchronizing it with the React UI. The goal is to maintain a consistent graph state between server and client, allowing the UI to recover its state on page reloads while continuing to process real-time updates.

## Current Architecture

The system currently has two main components for graph state management:

1. **React/Redux UI (Client-Side)**:

   - Maintains graph state in Redux store using Redux Toolkit
   - Processes events in real-time via WebSocket connection
   - Graph state is lost on page reload
   - Implemented in `ui-react/src/features/events/eventsApi.ts`

2. **WebSocket Server (Server-Side)**:
   - Acts as a Redis event stream relay
   - No current state management

# Event Logging Context Extension

## Overview

This document outlines potential attributes for the `ExecutionContext` object, designed to enhance the event logging system by passing down relevant data through the execution flow. The goal is to provide richer context for events emitted at various stages.

The `ExecutionContext` is immutable. The `with_` method creates _new_ context instances with updated information, allowing for scoped context augmentation without modifying the original context passed down the call stack.

## Attributes for `ExecutionContext` (Implemented & Potential)

This section lists attributes considered for the `ExecutionContext`. Attributes marked with (\*) were implemented in the context object itself.

1.  **`step` (\*)**: `Optional[int]`

    - **Purpose**: Tracks the current global execution step number.
    - **Scope**: Global for a run step.
    - **Propagation**: Set initially in `GraphRunEngine.forward_one_step_not_parallel`. Passed down the call stack.
    - **Event Enrichment**: Added to payloads by `_create_event` if not already present. Essential for sequencing.

2.  **`node_id` (\*)**: `Optional[str]`

# Event Payload Visualization Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines a plan to enhance the visualization of event payloads in our event logging system. Based on the analysis of new event types and their payloads, we need to update both the event table summary view and the detailed modal view to better present this information.

## Current Implementation Analysis

Our current implementation in `EventTable.tsx` already supports basic display of the new event types (node_created, plan_received, node_added, edge_added, inner_graph_built, node_result_available), but there are several areas for improvement:

1. **Payload Field Truncation**: Many fields are truncated with ellipsis (...) which loses valuable information
2. **Contextual Information**: Most events contain contextual fields (node_id, task_type, step, etc.) that could be displayed more clearly
3. **Relationship Visualization**: Edge events show relationships that could be better visualized
4. **Code/Response Formatting**: Long text blocks like LLM responses or plans are not well-formatted

## Improvement Goals

1. **Enhance Summary Display**: Improve the compact representation of events in the main table
2. **Upgrade Detail Modal**: Create a more structured, context-aware detail view for each event type
3. **Add Visual Elements**: Incorporate appropriate visualizations for different event types

# Building Node Metadata & Event Visualization Popup in the Graph UI

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document explains how to implement a feature in the event-logging UI that allows users to click on a node in the graph visualization and view a modal popup containing:

- Node metadata (ID, type, goal, status, etc.)
- All events related to that specific node (e.g., status changes, LLM/tool calls)
- Rich event details, similar to the existing event detail modal

This is intended for developers working on the `ui-react` frontend, and assumes familiarity with React, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript.
**Your task is to implement this modal functionality, following the guidance and steps outlined below. You'll be working primarily with React components and Redux state.**

---

## 2. Big Picture Context

The Recursive Agent Event Logging System provides real-time visibility into agent execution using a Redis-based event bus, a FastAPI WebSocket server, and a React/Redux UI. The UI visualizes both the event stream and the evolving task graph.

**Key architectural points:**

# Server-Side Event Storage and Initialization

## Overview

The Recursive Agent Event Logging System currently streams events in real-time from the agent to the UI via WebSockets. However, when a user refreshes the page or connects midway through an agent run, all historical events are lost. Your task is to implement server-side event storage and an initialization endpoint that allows the UI to load historical events on startup.

## Current System Architecture

Before diving into implementation, it's important to understand the current event system:

1. **Event Bus**: Publishes events to Redis streams (`recursive/utils/event_bus.py`)
2. **WebSocket Server**: Relays events from Redis to web clients (`recursive/utils/ws_server.py`)
3. **React UI**: Consumes events and maintains state in Redux (`ui-react/src/features/events/eventsApi.ts`)

The system already has similar functionality for graph state as described in `ttmp/2025-04-21/05-reduce-graph-events-server-side.md`.

## Design Goals

Your implementation should:

# Redis Streams for Event Logging: A Developer's Guide

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of how Redis Streams are used within the Recursive Agent project for handling real-time event logging and monitoring. It's intended for developers new to Redis Streams or this specific eventing mechanism.

We use Redis Streams as the backbone of our event bus, allowing different parts of the agent to publish events (like "step started", "LLM call completed") and enabling consumers (like our WebSocket server) to listen and react to these events in real-time.

## What are Redis Streams?

At its core, a Redis Stream is an **append-only log** data structure. Think of it like a log file, but managed within Redis, offering persistence and efficient querying capabilities.

Key characteristics:

1.  **Append-Only:** New entries (events, in our case) are always added to the end.

# SQLite Event Storage Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you implement SQLite storage for the Recursive Agent Event Logging System. The goal is to persist all events to a SQLite database and optionally reload the latest session when starting the WebSocket server. Additionally, we'll store the graph structure and node data to enable full session replay and analysis.

## Background

The Recursive Agent Event Logging System currently uses Redis streams to handle real-time event distribution. Events are published to Redis by various components and then read by the WebSocket server to forward to web clients. However, these events are not persisted long-term, making it difficult to analyze past runs or recover state after a restart.

### Current Event Flow

# WriteHERE Recursive Engine: System Overview

## Introduction

WriteHERE is a sophisticated recursive task planning and execution framework designed to help large language models (LLMs) produce more coherent, well-structured documents. Unlike simpler LLM frameworks that use a single prompt for generation, WriteHERE employs a recursive decomposition strategy that mirrors how human writers approach complex writing tasks.

This guide provides a high-level overview of the system architecture to help developers understand the key components and how they interact.

## System Architecture

At its core, WriteHERE implements a hierarchical state machine where tasks are represented as nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The execution of these tasks is governed by state transitions and agent-based processing. The system follows these key steps:

1. Breaking down a large writing task into logical sections
2. Decomposing sections into specific research, reasoning, and writing tasks
3. Executing atomic tasks and synthesizing results upward

The architecture consists of four main components:

# WriteHERE Node System and State Machine

## Introduction to WriteHERE

WriteHERE is a recursive task planning and execution framework that enables LLMs to generate well-structured documents. The system breaks down complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks using a hierarchical approach similar to how human writers work.

This guide focuses on the **Node System** and its **State Machine**, which form the backbone of the WriteHERE architecture.

## Node System Overview

In WriteHERE, each writing task is represented as a `Node` in a graph structure. Nodes can be nested hierarchically, with parent nodes delegating work to child nodes in their "inner graph." This allows the system to decompose complex tasks into simpler ones.

There are two main types of nodes:

1. **PLAN_NODE**: Nodes that will be further decomposed into subtasks
2. **EXECUTE_NODE**: Atomic nodes that perform a single action (writing, reasoning, or retrieval)

## Node Data Structure

A node contains multiple important fields:

# WriteHERE Agent System

## Introduction to WriteHERE

WriteHERE is a recursive task planning and execution framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to break down complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks. One of the core components of this system is the **Agent System**, which provides specialized modules that perform specific actions on nodes.

This guide focuses on how the Agent System works, its key components, and how to debug it effectively.

## Agent System Overview

In WriteHERE, agents are specialized classes responsible for performing specific actions on nodes in the task graph. The agent system uses a proxy pattern to dynamically select and instantiate the appropriate agent for each action required by a node.

The main agent types include:

1. **Planning Agent** (`UpdateAtomPlanningAgent`): Decomposes tasks into subtasks
2. **Execution Agent** (`SimpleExcutor`): Performs writing, reasoning, or search tasks
3. **Aggregation Agent** (`FinalAggregateAgent`): Synthesizes results from subtasks
4. **Reflection Agents**: Evaluate and potentially revise execution

# WriteHERE Memory System and Context Management

## Introduction to WriteHERE

WriteHERE is a recursive task planning and execution framework that enables LLMs to generate well-structured documents. The system decomposes complex writing tasks into a hierarchy of subtasks represented as nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

This guide focuses on the **Memory System**, which is responsible for managing context, caching node information, and maintaining the growing document as tasks are executed.

## Memory System Overview

The Memory system serves as a shared state repository that:

1. Tracks the growing document
2. Caches node information
3. Provides context between executions
4. Facilitates information sharing between nodes

The Memory system is crucial for maintaining coherence across the generated content and ensuring that subtasks have access to relevant context from other parts of the document.

# WriteHERE Task Planning and Decomposition

## Introduction to WriteHERE

WriteHERE is a recursive task planning and execution framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to break down complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks. One of the most critical components of this system is the **Task Planning and Decomposition** process, which is responsible for transforming high-level writing goals into a structured hierarchy of executable tasks.

This guide focuses on how the planning process works, how plans are created by LLMs, and how they are converted into executable graph structures.

## Task Planning Overview

Task planning in WriteHERE involves:

1. Using an LLM to decompose a task into logical subtasks
2. Converting that plan into a graph of node objects
3. Establishing dependencies between tasks
4. Preparing the nodes for execution

This process happens recursively, allowing complex tasks to be broken down into increasingly specific subtasks until atomic execution nodes are reached.

# WriteHERE Task Execution

## Introduction to WriteHERE

WriteHERE is a recursive task planning and execution framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to break down complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks. After tasks are planned and organized into a graph structure, the system needs to execute the atomic tasks at the leaves of the task hierarchy.

This guide focuses on the **Task Execution** process, which is responsible for performing the actual writing, reasoning, and search operations that produce the content of the final document.

## Task Execution Overview

Task execution in WriteHERE involves:

1. Processing `EXECUTE_NODE` instances that represent atomic tasks
2. Determining the task type (COMPOSITION, REASONING, or RETRIEVAL)
3. Providing appropriate context from memory and dependencies
4. Calling the LLM with a specialized prompt or performing search operations
5. Processing the results and storing them in the node

The execution engine handles one node at a time, ensuring that all dependencies are completed before a node is executed.

# WriteHERE Result Aggregation

## Introduction to WriteHERE

WriteHERE is a recursive task planning and execution framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to break down complex writing tasks into manageable subtasks. After tasks are planned and executed, the system needs to synthesize the results of subtasks into coherent, unified outputs.

This guide focuses on the **Result Aggregation** process, which is responsible for combining the outputs of multiple subtasks into a cohesive whole that fulfills the parent task's goal.

## Result Aggregation Overview

Result aggregation in WriteHERE involves:

1. Collecting results from all completed subtasks in a node's inner graph
2. Providing these results, along with the parent task's goal, to the aggregation agent
3. Using an LLM to synthesize the results into a coherent output
4. Storing the synthesized result in the parent node

This process ensures that the outputs of atomic tasks are properly integrated into the overall document structure.
