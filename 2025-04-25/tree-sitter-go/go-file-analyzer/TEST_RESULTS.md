   - Reduced memory allocations in the parser
   - Improved memory reuse for large file analysis

2. **Parser Performance**:
   - Optimized Tree-sitter query patterns for faster function extraction
   - Added caching for frequently accessed file content

3. **Web Server Efficiency**:
   - Implemented proper caching headers for static resources
   - Added compression for JSON responses
   - Optimized file content delivery

4. **UI Performance**:
   - Lazy loading of visualization components
   - Virtual scrolling for large code files
   - Throttled event handlers for better responsiveness

## Browser Compatibility

The web interface was tested on various browsers to ensure compatibility:

| Browser           | Version        | Status   | Notes                                   |
|-------------------|----------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Chrome            | 121+           | ✅ Pass   | Full functionality                       |
| Firefox           | 115+           | ✅ Pass   | Full functionality                       |

| Edge              | 110+           | ✅ Pass   | Full functionality                       |
| Mobile Chrome     | Android 13+    | ✅ Pass   | Responsive design works well on mobile   |
| Mobile Safari     | iOS 16+        | ✅ Pass   | Responsive design works well on mobile   |

## Known Limitations

During testing, the following limitations were identified:

1. **Very Large Codebases**: For projects with thousands of files, memory usage can become significant and analysis time can exceed 30 seconds.

2. **Advanced Go Features**: Some advanced Go language features (like type parameters/generics in Go 1.18+) may not be fully analyzed in all cases.

3. **Custom Build Tags**: The analyzer does not consider build constraints when analyzing files, so all functions are included regardless of build tags.

4. **Visualization Performance**: Complex visualizations with many nodes can become slow on less powerful devices.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

Based on the testing results, the following improvements are recommended for future versions:

1. **Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel file analysis to improve performance on multi-core systems.

2. **Incremental Analysis**: Add support for incremental analysis to only process changed files.

3. **Enhanced LSP Integration**: Improve integration with the Go Language Server Protocol for more accurate function usage information.

4. **Advanced Visualizations**: Add more visualization types, such as call graphs and code coverage overlays.

5. **Performance Profiling**: Add built-in performance profiling to identify bottlenecks in specific codebases.

6. **Extended Language Support**: Consider adding support for other languages beyond Go.

## Conclusion

The Go File Analyzer has been thoroughly tested with various Go codebases and has proven to be reliable, efficient, and user-friendly. It successfully handles a wide range of edge cases and error conditions, making it suitable for analyzing both small and large Go projects.

The application demonstrates good performance characteristics, with room for further optimization for very large codebases. The web interface provides an intuitive way to explore code structure and relationships, with interactive visualizations enhancing the code exploration experience.
