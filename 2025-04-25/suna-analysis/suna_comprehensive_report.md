## Implementation Details

### Key Algorithms

SUNA implements several sophisticated algorithms:

1. **Agent Decision Loop**: The core algorithm that drives the agent's behavior, balancing autonomy and user control. It follows this pattern:
   ```
   function run_agent(thread_id, project_id, sandbox, ...):
       initialize tools and thread manager
       check billing status
       
       for iteration in range(max_iterations):
           # Get conversation context
           messages = get_thread_messages(thread_id)
           
           # Check token count and summarize if needed
           if token_count > threshold:
               summarize_context(thread_id)
               
           # Call LLM with messages
           llm_response = call_llm(messages, tools, model)
           
           # Process response for tool calls
           for chunk in llm_response:
               # Parse for tool calls
               tool_calls = extract_tool_calls(chunk)
               
               # Execute tools and get results
               for tool_call in tool_calls:
                   result = execute_tool(tool_call)
                   # Add tool result back to conversation
                   add_result_to_thread(result)
                   
               # Stream response to client
               yield chunk
           
           # Check for termination signals
           if "ask" in response or "complete" in response:
               break
   ```

2. **XML Tool Call Extraction**: A regex-based algorithm for extracting XML-formatted tool calls from streaming text:
   ```python
   def _extract_xml_chunks(self, text):
       chunks = []
       pattern = r"<([\w-]+)[\s>].*?<\/\1>"
       xml_matches = re.finditer(pattern, text, re.DOTALL)
       
       for match in xml_matches:
           chunks.append(match.group(0))
       
       return chunks
   ```

3. **Context Summarization**: Manages LLM context windows by periodically summarizing conversation history:
   ```python
   async def check_and_summarize_if_needed(self, thread_id, add_message_callback, model, force=False):
       # Get current token count
       token_count = await self.get_thread_token_count(thread_id)
       
       # Check if summarization is needed
       if token_count < self.token_threshold and not force:
           return False
           
       # Get messages to summarize (all since last summary)
       messages = await self.get_messages_for_summarization(thread_id)
       
       # Create summary using separate LLM call
       summary = await self.create_summary(thread_id, messages, model)
       
       if summary:
           # Add summary as a special message
           await add_message_callback(
               thread_id=thread_id,
               type="summary",
               content=summary,
               is_llm_message=True
           )
           return True
   ```

4. **Parallel Tool Execution**: Efficiently executes multiple tools concurrently:
   ```python
   async def _execute_tools_parallel(self, contexts):
       tasks = []
       for context in contexts:
           task = self._execute_single_tool(context)
           tasks.append(task)
       
       # Execute all tools in parallel
       await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
       
       return contexts
   ```

5. **Redis-Based Agent Control**: Uses pub/sub for distributed agent control:
   ```python
   async def stop_agent_run(agent_run_id, error_message=None):
       # Update agent run status in database
       status = "failed" if error_message else "stopped"
       await update_agent_run_status(client, agent_run_id, status, error=error_message)
       
       # Send stop signal to global channel
       await redis.publish(f"agent_run:{agent_run_id}:control", "STOP")
       
       # Find all instances handling this agent run
       instance_keys = await redis.keys(f"active_run:*:{agent_run_id}")
       
       # Send stop signal to each instance
       for key in instance_keys:
           instance_id = parts[1]
           await redis.publish(f"agent_run:{agent_run_id}:control:{instance_id}", "STOP")
   ```

### Data Structures

SUNA employs several key data structures:

1. **Messages**: The primary data structure for communication:
   ```json
   {
     "message_id": "uuid",
     "thread_id": "uuid",

       "tag_name": "tag_name",
       "mappings": [parameter mappings],
       "example": "usage example"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Tool Result**: Standardized tool execution result:

     "error": "exception if any",
     "assistant_message_id": "uuid",
     "parsing_details": { parsing metadata }
   }
   ```

### Error Handling

Error handling in SUNA is comprehensive and robust:

1. **LLM API Errors**: Handled with retries and exponential backoff:
   ```python
   async def make_llm_api_call(messages, model_name, ...):
       for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):
           try:
               response = await litellm.acompletion(**params)
               return response
           except (litellm.exceptions.RateLimitError, OpenAIError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
               last_error = e
               await handle_error(e, attempt, MAX_RETRIES)
   ```

2. **Tool Execution Errors**: Captured and returned as structured responses:
   ```python
   async def _execute_single_tool(self, context):
       try:
           # Execute the tool
           tool_info = self.tool_registry.get_tool(context.function_name)
           if not tool_info:
               context.error = ValueError(f"Tool {context.function_name} not found")
               return context
               
           # Call the tool method
           result = await getattr(tool_info['instance'], context.function_name)(**arguments)
           context.result = result
           return context
       except Exception as e:
           context.error = e
           return context
   ```

3. **Database Errors**: Handled with retries and transaction management:
   ```python
   async def update_agent_run_status(client, agent_run_id, status, error=None, responses=None):
       try:
           # Retry up to 3 times
           for retry in range(3):
               try:
                   update_result = await client.table('agent_runs').update(update_data).eq("id", agent_run_id).execute()
                   return True
               except Exception as db_error:
                   if retry < 2:  # Not the last retry yet
                       await asyncio.sleep(0.5 * (2 ** retry))  # Exponential backoff
               
       except Exception as e:
           logger.error(f"Unexpected error updating agent run status: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
           return False
   ```

4. **Redis Operation Errors**: Handled with specialized retry logic:
   ```python
   async def with_retry(func, *args, **kwargs):
       retries = 0
       while retries < MAX_RETRIES:
           try:
               return await func(*args, **kwargs)
           except (redis.ConnectionError, redis.TimeoutError, ConnectionResetError) as e:
               retries += 1
               # Calculate backoff with jitter
               delay = min(BASE_RETRY_DELAY * (2 ** (retries - 1)), MAX_RETRY_DELAY)
               jitter = delay * RETRY_JITTER * random.uniform(-1, 1)
               wait_time = delay + jitter
               await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
   ```

5. **Agent Runtime Errors**: Captured and reported with detailed information:
   ```python
   try:
       # Run the agent
       agent_gen = run_agent(...)
       async for response in agent_gen:
           # Process response
   except Exception as e:
       # Handle errors
       error_message = str(e)
       traceback_str = traceback.format_exc()
       
       # Add error to responses
       error_response = {
           "type": "status",
           "status": "error",
           "message": error_message
       }
       
       # Update run status
       await update_agent_run_status(client, agent_run_id, "failed", error=f"{error_message}\n{traceback_str}")
   ```
