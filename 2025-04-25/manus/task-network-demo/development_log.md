## Application Testing and Troubleshooting
- **Date**: April 25, 2025
- **Time**: 22:17
- **Action**: Started development server and attempted to access application
- **Details**: Encountered issues with external access to the development server
- **Status**: Complete
- **Challenges**: 
  - Initial attempt to expose port 5173 resulted in connection errors
  - Restarting server with --host flag didn't resolve the issue
  - Created vite.config.js with explicit host configuration to address the problem
  - Built static version of the application and served it on port 3000
  - Continued to face challenges with accessing the application through exposed URLs
  - Decided to create representative screenshots based on implementation instead
