      Thought: I now have a comprehensive understanding of how main.go interacts with other components in the codebase. Let me summarize my findings.
      Final Answer: After exploring the codebase, I can explain how main.go interacts with other components:

      1. The main.go file is the entry point of the application and contains the main function that gets executed when the program runs.

      2. Main.go has two import dependencies:
          - The standard library package "fmt" for printing to the console
          - A custom package "github.com/example/project/utils" which contains utility functions

      3. The utils package is organized into two files:
          - math.go: Contains mathematical utility functions
          - strings.go: Contains string manipulation utility functions

      4. In the main function, main.go specifically interacts with the utils package by calling the Calculate function from math.go:
          ```go
          result := utils.Calculate(10, 20)
          ```
          This function takes two integers (10 and 20), adds them together, and returns the result.

      5. The Calculate function is defined in utils/math.go as:
          ```go
          func Calculate(a, b int) int {
              return a + b
          }
          ```

      6. While main.go doesn't currently use any functions from utils/strings.go, those functions (Concat and ToUpper) are available for use if needed in the future.

      The codebase follows a simple modular structure where utility functions are separated into their own package and organized by functionality (math vs. strings), promoting code reusability and maintainability. The main.go file serves as the orchestrator that imports and uses these utility functions to perform its tasks.
