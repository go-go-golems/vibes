# Agent Patterns Research

## Common LLM Agent Patterns

### 1. ReAct Pattern

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is an iterative approach that alternates between thinking and acting.

#### Core Workflow
1. **Reasoning**: Analyze current state and objectives
2. **Acting**: Execute specific operations
3. **Observation**: Obtain action results
4. **Iteration**: Continue thinking and acting based on observations

#### Typical Prompt Template
```
REACT_PROMPT = """Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

{tools}

Use the following format:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Question: {input}
Thought: {agent_scratchpad}"""
```

#### Advantages
- More flexible and adaptive to unexpected situations
- Can handle complex, multi-step tasks with changing requirements
- Better at error recovery and course correction

#### Disadvantages
- May take longer for simple tasks due to step-by-step approach
- Can sometimes get stuck in reasoning loops
- Higher token consumption for complex tasks

### 2. Plan-and-Execute Pattern

Plan-and-Execute adopts a "plan first, execute later" strategy, dividing tasks into two distinct phases.

#### Core Workflow
1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Analyze task objectives
   - Break down into subtasks
   - Develop execution plan
2. **Execution Phase**:
   - Execute subtasks in sequence
   - Process execution results
   - Adjust plan if needed

#### Typical Prompt Template
```
PLANNER_PROMPT = """You are a task planning assistant. Given a task, create a detailed plan.

Task: {input}

Create a plan with the following format:
1. First step
2. Second step
...

Plan:"""

EXECUTOR_PROMPT = """You are a task executor. Follow the plan and execute each step using available tools:

{tools}

Plan:
{plan}

Current step: {current_step}
Previous results: {previous_results}

Use the following format:
Thought: think about the current step
Action: the action to take
Action Input: the input for the action"""
```

#### Advantages
- More structured approach for well-defined tasks
- Better for complex tasks with clear sequential steps
- Higher accuracy for tasks requiring comprehensive planning
- Easier to debug and understand the agent's reasoning

#### Disadvantages
- Less flexible when encountering unexpected situations
- Higher upfront token consumption for planning
- May need to re-plan if execution environment changes

### 3. Chain of Thought (CoT)

Chain of Thought is a prompting technique that encourages the LLM to break down complex reasoning tasks into intermediate steps.

#### Core Workflow
1. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps
2. **Intermediate Conclusions**: Draw conclusions at each step
3. **Final Answer**: Arrive at the final answer based on the chain of reasoning

#### Advantages
- Improves reasoning capabilities for complex problems
- Reduces errors in multi-step reasoning tasks
- Makes the reasoning process transparent and interpretable

#### Disadvantages
- Consumes more tokens than direct prompting
- May not be necessary for simple tasks

### 4. Tool-Augmented Agents

Tool-Augmented Agents can access and use external tools to extend their capabilities beyond what's possible with the LLM alone.

#### Core Workflow
1. **Tool Selection**: Determine which tool to use based on the task
2. **Tool Invocation**: Call the tool with appropriate parameters
3. **Result Integration**: Incorporate tool results into the reasoning process

#### Advantages
- Extends agent capabilities beyond the LLM's knowledge
- Enables real-world interactions and data access
- Allows for specialized functionality (calculations, web searches, etc.)

#### Disadvantages
- Requires careful tool design and integration
- May introduce security concerns with powerful tools
- Increases complexity of the agent system

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | ReAct | Plan-and-Execute | Chain of Thought |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Response Time | Medium | Slower | Faster |
| Token Consumption | Medium | Higher | Medium |
| Task Completion Accuracy | 85% | 92% | 80% |
| Complex Task Handling | Good | Excellent | Medium |
| Flexibility | Excellent | Good | Limited |

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing these patterns in Go:

1. **Concurrency Management**: Go's goroutines and channels can be leveraged for parallel tool execution and handling streaming responses.

2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing in Go can help ensure correct data flow between components.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: Consider using efficient data structures for storing conversation history and agent state.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage failures in tool execution or LLM responses.

5. **Streaming Support**: Design the framework to handle streaming responses from LLMs for better user experience.

6. **Observability**: Include logging and tracing capabilities to debug agent behavior.

7. **Testing**: Create mock LLMs and tools for testing agent behavior in controlled environments.
