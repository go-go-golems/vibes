## 5. Conclusions and Recommendations

### 5.2 Saga Transaction Performance

Saga transaction success rate is only 94.0%, which is below the recommended 95% threshold. Consider reviewing compensation mechanisms and error handling in the saga orchestration.

Average saga transaction duration is 0.46 seconds, which is acceptable. Continue monitoring for any increases in transaction duration.

### 5.3 High Latency Service Communications

The following service communications have high latency and could be optimized:

- **inventory-service -> notification-service**: 0.726 seconds average latency
- **notification-service -> shipping-service**: 0.584 seconds average latency
- **shipping-service -> analytics-service**: 1.084 seconds average latency
- **analytics-service -> order-service**: 11.534 seconds average latency

### 5.4 General Recommendations

1. **Implement Circuit Breakers**: For services with frequent connection errors to external systems
2. **Enhance Error Logging**: Add more context to error messages for better troubleshooting
3. **Optimize Database Connections**: Consider connection pooling or caching frequently accessed data
4. **Implement Retry Mechanisms**: For transient failures in service communication
5. **Add Health Checks**: Monitor service health and implement automatic recovery
