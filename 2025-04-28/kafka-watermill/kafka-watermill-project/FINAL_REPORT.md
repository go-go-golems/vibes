## 3. Microservices Implementation

### 3.1 Common Interface Definition Language (IDL)

The system uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) as the Interface Definition Language to define a common schema for events. This allows for consistent event structures across different programming languages.

**Key IDL definitions:**

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package order;

option go_package = "github.com/scrapybara/kafka-watermill-project/idl/go";
option java_package = "com.scrapybara.kw.idl";
option ruby_package = "Ruby::IDL";

message OrderCreatedEvent {
  string order_id = 1;
  string customer_id = 2;
  repeated OrderItem items = 3;
  double total_amount = 4;
  string status = 5;
  int64 created_at = 6;
}

message OrderItem {
  string item_id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  int32 quantity = 3;
  double price = 4;
}

// Additional event definitions...
```

### 3.2 Go Microservices with Watermill

The core services are implemented in Go using the Watermill framework, which provides a high-level abstraction for event-driven applications. Each service follows the same basic structure:

1. **Message Router**: Configures message routing and handling
2. **Event Handlers**: Process incoming events and produce outgoing events
3. **Domain Logic**: Implements the business logic of the service
4. **API Layer**: Exposes REST endpoints for external interaction

**Example of router configuration:**

```go
func NewRouter(kafkaAddr string) (*message.Router, error) {
    router, err := message.NewRouter(message.RouterConfig{}, logger)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    kafkaPublisher, err := kafka.NewPublisher(
        kafka.PublisherConfig{
            Brokers:   []string{kafkaAddr},
            Marshaler: kafka.DefaultMarshaler{},
        },
        logger,
    )
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    kafkaSubscriber, err := kafka.NewSubscriber(
        kafka.SubscriberConfig{
            Brokers:     []string{kafkaAddr},
            Unmarshaler: kafka.DefaultMarshaler{},
        },
        logger,
    )
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Configure handlers
    router.AddHandler(
        "order.created.handler",
        "order.created",
        kafkaSubscriber,
        "order.confirmed",
        kafkaPublisher,
        handlers.NewOrderCreatedHandler().Handle,
    )

    return router, nil
}
```

### 3.3 Kotlin Microservice

The Shipping Service is implemented in Kotlin using Spring Boot and Spring Kafka. It follows a reactive approach to handle Kafka events.

**Key components:**

1. **Kafka Consumer**: Listens to order-related events
2. **Service Layer**: Implements shipping logic
3. **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence
4. **Event Producer**: Publishes shipping events back to Kafka

**Example Kafka consumer in Kotlin:**

```kotlin
@Component
class OrderEventConsumer(
    private val shippingService: ShippingService
) {
    private val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(OrderEventConsumer::class.java)
    
    @KafkaListener(topics = ["order.confirmed"], groupId = "shipping-service")
    fun handleOrderConfirmed(orderConfirmedEvent: OrderConfirmedEvent) {
        logger.info("Received order confirmed event for order ${orderConfirmedEvent.orderId}")
        
        try {
            val shipment = shippingService.initiateShipment(orderConfirmedEvent)
            logger.info("Shipment ${shipment.id} created for order ${orderConfirmedEvent.orderId}")
        } catch (ex: Exception) {
            logger.error("Error processing shipment for order ${orderConfirmedEvent.orderId}", ex)
        }
    }
}
```

### 3.4 Ruby Microservice

The Analytics Service is implemented in Ruby, consuming events from Kafka and performing analytics processing.

**Key components:**

1. **Kafka Consumer**: Processes events from multiple topics
2. **Event Store**: Implements event sourcing pattern for analytics data
3. **Query Models**: Implements the query side of CQRS pattern

**Example Ruby Kafka consumer:**

```ruby
class EventConsumer
  def initialize
    @kafka = Kafka.new(seed_brokers: ["kafka:9092"], client_id: "analytics-service")
    @consumer = @kafka.consumer(group_id: "analytics-consumer")
    @event_processor = EventProcessor.new
  end
  
  def start
    @consumer.subscribe("order.created", "order.confirmed", "order.cancelled")
    
    @consumer.each_message do |message|
      begin
        process_message(message)
      rescue => e
        Rails.logger.error("Error processing event: #{e.message}")
      end
    end
  end
  
  private
  
  def process_message(message)
    event = JSON.parse(message.value)
    Rails.logger.info("Processing event #{message.topic} for order #{event['order_id']}")
    
    @event_processor.process(message.topic, event)
  end
end
```

## 4. Event-Driven Patterns Implementation

### 4.1 Saga Pattern

The Saga pattern is implemented to manage distributed transactions across microservices. The Order Service acts as the saga orchestrator, coordinating the steps and handling compensating transactions when failures occur.

**Example saga implementation in Go:**

```go
// OrderSaga orchestrates the order processing flow
type OrderSaga struct {
    publisher message.Publisher
    logger    watermill.LoggerAdapter
}

// Start begins the saga for order processing
func (s *OrderSaga) Start(ctx context.Context, order *models.Order) error {
    // Step 1: Validate payment
    paymentEvent := events.NewPaymentRequestEvent(order.ID, order.CustomerID, order.TotalAmount)
    err := s.publisher.Publish("payment.request", message.NewMessage(
        watermill.NewUUID(),
        paymentEvent.Marshal(),
    ))
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to publish payment request: %w", err)
    }
    
    return nil
}

// HandlePaymentResult processes the payment result and continues the saga
func (s *OrderSaga) HandlePaymentResult(paymentResult *events.PaymentResultEvent) error {
    if !paymentResult.Success {
        // Compensating transaction: Cancel order
        return s.cancelOrder(paymentResult.OrderID, "Payment failed")
    }
    
    // Step 2: Reserve inventory
    // ...
    
    return nil
}

// Additional handlers for other saga steps...
```

### 4.2 Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing pattern is implemented to maintain a complete history of events and rebuild state from that history. The Analytics Service uses this pattern to generate reports and analytics.

**Example event sourcing implementation in Go:**

```go
// OrderAggregate is an event-sourced aggregate
type OrderAggregate struct {
    ID         string
    CustomerID string
    Items      []OrderItem
    TotalAmount float64
    Status     string
    CreatedAt  time.Time
    UpdatedAt  time.Time
    
    events []DomainEvent
}

// Apply applies an event to the aggregate and updates its state
func (a *OrderAggregate) Apply(event DomainEvent) {
    switch e := event.(type) {
    case *OrderCreatedEvent:
        a.ID = e.OrderID
        a.CustomerID = e.CustomerID
        a.Items = e.Items
        a.TotalAmount = e.TotalAmount
        a.Status = "created"
        a.CreatedAt = time.Now()
        a.UpdatedAt = time.Now()
    case *OrderConfirmedEvent:
        a.Status = "confirmed"
        a.UpdatedAt = time.Now()
    case *OrderCancelledEvent:
        a.Status = "cancelled"
        a.UpdatedAt = time.Now()
    }
    
    a.events = append(a.events, event)
}

// CreateOrder creates a new order and records the event
func (a *OrderAggregate) CreateOrder(orderID, customerID string, items []OrderItem, totalAmount float64) {
    event := NewOrderCreatedEvent(orderID, customerID, items, totalAmount)
    a.Apply(event)
}

// GetUncommittedEvents returns the uncommitted events
func (a *OrderAggregate) GetUncommittedEvents() []DomainEvent {
    return a.events
}
```

### 4.3 CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

The CQRS pattern is implemented to separate read and write operations. The system uses Kafka as the event store for the command side and maintains optimized read models for the query side.

**Example CQRS implementation:**

```go
// Command side
func (s *OrderService) CreateOrder(ctx context.Context, cmd *commands.CreateOrderCommand) (string, error) {
    // Create a new order aggregate
    orderID := uuid.New().String()
    order := &domain.OrderAggregate{}
    
    // Apply the command and generate events
    order.CreateOrder(orderID, cmd.CustomerID, cmd.Items, cmd.TotalAmount)
    
    // Store the events
    events := order.GetUncommittedEvents()
    for _, event := range events {
        err := s.eventStore.Save(event)
        if err != nil {
            return "", err
        }
    }
    
    return orderID, nil
}

// Query side
func (s *OrderQueryService) GetOrder(ctx context.Context, orderID string) (*models.OrderDTO, error) {
    // Fetch from read model directly
    return s.orderRepository.FindByID(orderID)
}

// Event handler to update read model
func (h *OrderEventHandler) HandleOrderCreated(event *events.OrderCreatedEvent) error {
    // Update the read model
    order := &models.OrderDTO{
        ID:         event.OrderID,
        CustomerID: event.CustomerID,
        Items:      mapItems(event.Items),
        TotalAmount: event.TotalAmount,
        Status:     "created",
        CreatedAt:  event.CreatedAt,
    }
    
    return h.orderRepository.Save(order)
}
```

## 5. Logging and Monitoring

### 5.1 Logging Infrastructure

The system uses the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging. This setup provides a unified view of logs from all microservices and Kafka.

**Components:**

1. **Filebeat**: Collects logs from Docker containers
2. **Logstash**: Processes and normalizes log data
3. **Elasticsearch**: Stores and indexes log data
4. **Kibana**: Provides visualization and analysis

**Logstash configuration:**

```
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
  
  tcp {
    port => 5000
    codec => json
  }
  
  kafka {
    bootstrap_servers => "kafka:9092"
    topics => ["service.logs"]
    codec => json
    client_id => "logstash-kafka-input"
    group_id => "logstash-consumer"
    auto_offset_reset => "latest"
  }
}

filter {
  if [type] == "container" {
    # Extract container metadata
    grok {
      match => { "source" => "/var/lib/docker/containers/%{DATA:container_id}/%{GREEDYDATA}" }
    }
    
    # Try to extract JSON log message if applicable
    json {
      source => "message"
      target => "log"
      skip_on_invalid_json => true
    }
    
    # Extract service name from container name
    mutate {
      add_field => { "service" => "%{[container][name]}" }
    }
  }
  
  # Additional processing...
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["elasticsearch:9200"]
    index => "logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    manage_template => false
  }
  
  # Send high severity logs to a separate index
  if [log_level] == "ERROR" or [log_level] == "FATAL" or [log_level] == "SEVERE" {
    elasticsearch {
      hosts => ["elasticsearch:9200"]
      index => "error-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
      manage_template => false
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Log Analysis

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of logs collected from the system during various test scenarios. The analysis provides insights into system behavior, error patterns, and performance characteristics.

**Analysis Highlights:**

1. **Log Volume Distribution**:
   - Total logs analyzed: 2,100
   - Distribution across services was relatively even, with each service generating around 200-250 log entries
   - Zookeeper had the highest log count at 381 entries

2. **Log Level Distribution**:
   - INFO: 988 entries (47%)
   - WARN: 709 entries (34%)
   - DEBUG: 297 entries (14%)
   - ERROR: 89 entries (4%)
   - FATAL: 17 entries (1%)

3. **Error Analysis**:
   - Most common errors were related to external service connections (database, payment gateway, notification provider)
   - Payment service had the highest error rate (21 errors out of 256 logs)
   - Inventory shortages and payment failures were the most common business error scenarios

4. **Saga Transaction Analysis**:
   - 150 saga transactions were identified in the logs
   - Success rate was 94% (below the recommended 95% threshold)
   - Average saga duration was 0.46 seconds
   - Longest saga took 39.86 seconds to complete

5. **Service Communication Latency**:
   - Highest latency: analytics-service to order-service (11.53 seconds)
   - Notable high latencies:
     - shipping-service to analytics-service (1.08 seconds)
     - inventory-service to notification-service (0.73 seconds)
     - notification-service to shipping-service (0.58 seconds)

![Errors and Warnings by Service](log_analysis/charts/errors_warnings_per_service.png)

### 5.3 Recommendations Based on Log Analysis

1. **Improve Saga Success Rate**:
   - The 94% success rate for saga transactions is slightly below the recommended 95% threshold
   - Review compensation mechanisms and error handling in saga orchestration
   - Implement better retry strategies for transient failures

2. **Optimize Service Communication**:
   - Address high latency between services, particularly:
     - analytics-service to order-service (11.53 seconds)
     - shipping-service to analytics-service (1.08 seconds)
   - Consider implementing asynchronous processing for analytics to prevent blocking operational flows

3. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Implement circuit breakers for external service connections
   - Add more context to error messages for better troubleshooting
   - Implement automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

4. **Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Optimize database connections using connection pooling
   - Implement health checks for all services
   - Set up alerts for critical error patterns

## 6. Deployment and Testing
